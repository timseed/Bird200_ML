# Bird Identification using CUB 200 dataset

I stumbled acros the CUB dataset a few months ago, The link is [http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200-2011.html). 

With a long-weekend and litte to do I started trying to get some traction on using this data. FOr the following reasons

  - I like bird watching
  - I am terrible at identifying birds
  - I like Machine Learning
  - I really like Python
  - I do not do enought ML in my day job
